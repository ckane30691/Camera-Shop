[Live Site](https://camera-shop.herokuapp.com/)

## Site Features:
CameraShop is an Angular App that receives data via http and displays the results into a grid. It allows you to sort by name or SKU # and let's you search by product name.

## Spotted a bug?
If you find a bug, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/ckane30691/Camera-Shop/issues/new).

## Technologies Used:
* [Express](http://rubyonrails.org/) - Simple backend server to host files
* [Angular](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for building user interfaces
* [RxJS](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=rxjs) - library for transforming, composing, and querying streams of data.
* [Angular in-memory-web-api](https://github.com/angular/in-memory-web-api) - An in-memory web api for Angular demos and tests that emulates CRUD operations over a RESTy API.
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Statically typed javascript
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - Cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps
* [AWS S3 Buckets](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) - Cloud Service for serving images

## Future Directions for CameraShop
* Implement User Auth
* Implement Checkouts
* Implement Show Page for Cameras
* Hit Amazon's Product API instead of serving static data from an endpoint
